# Sales Summarizer (n8n Workflow)
Overview

This project helps sellers stay informed about their sales activity by automatically summarizing new or updated orders and sending the summary via email.

The automation is built using n8n and is powered by a free DeepSeek large language model. It monitors a Google Sheets sales list, generates a human-readable summary using AI, and delivers the result to a specified Gmail address.

This workflow is suitable for small sellers or teams who want lightweight, cost-effective sales awareness without complex dashboards.
